description: Forecasted total macro electricity demand at 30-minute and 24-hour prediction windows. Compared to the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), reduced average error by 39%, standard deviation by 46%, and maximum error by 44% when predicting at 30-minute intervals. AEMO is responsible for Australia's largest gas & electricity markets and power systems. I further forecasted residential electricity demand also at 30-minute and 24-hour prediction windows. My model achieved 80-90% accuracy for 30-minute windows, 60-80% accuracy for 24-hour windows.
