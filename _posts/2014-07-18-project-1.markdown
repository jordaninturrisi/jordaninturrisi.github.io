description: The Brownlow Medal is the AFL's highest individual honour which has been awarded since 1924 to the Fairest and Best player of each season. Voting is conducted by the field umpires immediately after each home-and-away match, with 3-votes awarded to the player believed to have been the best-on-ground, 2-votes for the second-best player and 1-vote for the third-best player on the day, in their opinion. Using data from 2500+ past matches with 50+ inputs, I trained a deep neural classifier to determine the probability that each player polls 3-, 2-, 1-, or 0-votes in each home-and-away match. The model's Top 5 ranked players account for 91% of all 3-votes, 80% of all 2-votes, and 66% of all 1-vote, whilst successfully predicting the player's receiving - 3-votes 57%, 2-votes 28%, 1-vote 20% of the time.
